# Values and References
  @Values: Values create copies.
  @References: References do not create copies. They point back to the original source.

  *Pass by Value*
    `language := "Go"` #=> 1. Primitive value is assigned to new variable and stored in new memory address
    `favoriteLanguage := language` #=> 2. A new memory address is allocated for the new variable that receives a copy of the original data.

    - Values use two different memory addresses to store exact copies of data. This is inefficient.

  *Pass by Reference*
    `language := "Go"` #=> 1. Primitive value is assigned to new variable and stored in new memory address
    `favoriteLanguage := &language` #=> Using the `&` operator, a reference to the existing memory address is assigned to the new variable.

    - References us a single memory address. This uses memory more efficiently.

  type gopher struct {
    name string
    age int
    isAdult bool
  }

  func main() {
    phil := &gopher{name: "Phil", age: 35}
    validateAge(phil)
    fmt.Println(phil)

  fun validateAge(g *gopher) {
    g.isAdult = g.age >= 21
  }

  - `*gopher` data types points back to the reference
