# Type inference
  :=

# Manual Type Declaration
  var <variable> int
  var args []string #=> bracket prefix indicates this is a collection of strings

# Static typing allows the Go compiler to check for type errors before the program is run

# Data Types
  - Choosing a datatype involves determining how much space is needed to store this value for later use.
  - Taking up too much storage is a waste of precious space.
  - Not reserving enough space can limit the amount of data we can store.

# Types
  int -> 42
  string -> "Hello"
  bool -> true or false
  []string -> ["acorn", "basket"]
