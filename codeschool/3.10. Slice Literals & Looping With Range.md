# Creating Slcies with Initial Values
  When we know beforehand which elements will be part of a slice, multiple calls to append will start looking too verbose.

# Slice Literal
  ```
    func main() {
      langs := []string{"Go", "Ruby", "JavaScript"}
      fmt.Println
    }
  ```

# Navigating a Slice with @for and @range
  * The range clause provides a way to iterate over slices. When only one value is used on the left of range, then this value will be the index for each element on the slice, one at a time.

  * By using range on a slice, we can be sure the indices used are always valid for that slice
    `for i := range langs` is like saying `langs.each`

  ```
    for main() {
      langs := getLangs()

      for i := range langs {
        fmt.Println(langs[i])
      }
    }
  ```

# Elements
  * Using range we can also read the index and the element associated with it at the same time. However, if we don't use a variable that's been assigned, then Go will produce an error.
    - Below, the code will produce an error because `i` is declared but not used

  ```
    for main() {
      langs := getLangs()

      for i, element := range langs {
        fmt.Println(element)
      }
    }
  ```

    - To fix this, use the underline character `_`

  ```
    for main() {
      langs := getLangs()

      for _, element := range langs {
        fmt.Println(element)
      }
    }
  ```
* Remember! @range assigns the `index` and not the element, so the following will produce an error:
  ```
    for element := range langs {
      fmt.Println(element)
    }
  ```
