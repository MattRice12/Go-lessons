# Structs

  ```
    type gopher struct {
      name string
      age int
    }
  ```

# Struct literal
  ```
    type gopher struct {
      name string
      age int
    }

    func main() {
      gopher1 := gopher{name: "Phil", age: 30}
      gopher2 := gopher{name: "Noodles", age: 90}
    }
  ```

* the struct creation code must be placed inside the main function
* the struct declaration code must be placed outside the main function

# Using struct for Encapsulation of Behavior
  - A struct contains behavior in the form of methods. The way we define methods on a struct is by writing a regular function and specifying the struct as the explicit receiver.

  ```
    type gopher struct {
      name string
      age int
    }

    func (g gopher) jump() string {
      if g.age < 65 {
        return g.name + " can jump HIGH"
      }
      return g.name + " can still jump"
    }

    func main() {
      gopher1 := gopher(name: "Phil", age: 30)
      fmt.Println(gopher1.jump())

      gopher2 := gopher{name: "Noodles", age: 90}
      fmt.Println(gopher2.jump())
    }
  ```
