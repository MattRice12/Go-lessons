# For Loop
  The for loop is the only looping construct in Go

  for <init>; <condition>; <post> {
    [ <init>      --> executed before the first iteration    ]
    [ <condition> --> executed before every iteration        ]
    [ <post>      --> executed at the end of every iteration ]
  }


# Example
  ```
    package main
    import "fmt"

    func main() {
      for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        fmt.Println(i)
      }
    }
  ```

# Example 2
  The for loop components are optional. We can create loops with variables declared previously in the code and a single condition expression:
  ```
    func main() {
      i := 0
      isLessThanFice := true
      for isLessThanFive {
        if i >= 5 {
          isLessThanFive = false
          -OR-
          break (this stops 1 Println early)
        }
        fmt.Println(i)
        i++
      }
    }
  ```
# Infinite Loops
  ```
    func main() {
      for {
        if someListeningFunction() {
          break
        }
      }
    }
  ```
