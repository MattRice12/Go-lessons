# What is Go?
  Go is an open-source programming language created by Google in 2007
  - Go is a compiled language.
  - Statically typed
  - Fast

# What types of programs should we Go for?
  @System-Programs: Lower-level programs that provide services to other systems rather than servicing users directly.
    - Lower-level programs will often not have a graphical user interface, but instead will run from terminal/command line.
    - E.g., APIs, Game engines, Network applications, CLI apps

  @Application-programs: Programs that provide services directly to users that have no technical background.
    - E.g., E-commerce, To-do lists, text editors, music players.

# Code
  All go programs must have a `main` package and `main` function
  Packages used by the program must be explicitly imported.

  | package main
  |
  | import "fmt"
  |
  | func main() {
  |  
  | }
